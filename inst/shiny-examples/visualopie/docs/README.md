## Navigating VisualOPIE

Welcome to VisualOPIE! We aim to provide the best possible user interaction with our data visualisation tool and provide a comprehensive understanding about the performance of students using our social robots.

* Our app features 4 different tabs: Dashboard, User, Language and Activity. The navigation panel for these tabs can be found on the left hand side of the screen.<br /><br />
* The dashboard presents a summary of interactions including the duration spent per activity as well as with per language.<br /><br />
* The user page provides individual performance statistics that can be used by teachers to focus more attention to students who are not performing well.<br /><br />
* The language page provides language specific information, such as, which languages are being more interacted with and which are not.<br /><br />
* The activity page focuses on the interaction and performance per activity.

## Filtering visualisations
In order to customise the visualisation to display the desired information, VisualOPIE has been designed to be highly interactive. Some visualisations allow you to filter or specify which parts of the data you want to see, rather than all data. For example, in the language page you are able to specify languages of interest, or words of interest.

1. Clicking on the various tab options clearly allows visualisation of user-centric, language-centric and activity-centric data. <br /><br />
2. Under the language tab, a dropdown menu will allow you to filter the specific language data that you would like to visualise.<br /><br />
3. Further, you can also filter and visualise the specific words and the interaction summary with those words.<br /><br />
4. Under the users tab, a dropdown menu will provide the opportunity to understand each individual's performance record.
